<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hello there, I am Terence. I am currently pursuing a degree in Information Security at the National University of
Singapore (NUS).<br>
I am an information security enthusiast and also enjoys server administration.<br>
This portfolio documents my contributions towards <strong>OwlMoney</strong> for the module CS2113T Software Engineering &amp;
Object-Oriented Programming.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="about-the-project"><a class="link" href="#about-the-project">About the project</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My team and I were tasked with enhancing the basic command line interface (CLI) personal assistant,
Duke, for our software engineering project. We choose to morph it into a command line financial tracker called
OwlMoney. This enhanced application is designed to assist undergraduates and fresh graduates to track and manage
their finances. OwlMoney provides a simple and minimalistic CLI that presents information in an organized manner.
It is intuitive so that even users who are unfamiliar with CLI can use it with ease.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My role was to design and write codes for the <code>card</code> feature, which allow users to track and manage
their credit cards. The following sections illustrate the enhancements in detail, and also the relevant
information that I have added to the user and developer guide with reference to the enhancements.</p>

<p>This section shows the summary of my contributions to the project which include the coding, documentation
and other helpful contributions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Features implemented:</strong> I have implemented the ability to manage credit cards</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What it does</strong>: The <code>card</code> feature has <code>add</code>, <code>delete</code>, <code>edit</code>, and <code>list</code> commands which helps users manage
their credit cards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: Due to the popularity of credit cards, many people including students owns one.
Because different cards provide different benefits, some people owns several cards.
This feature gives users the ability to manage their credit cards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong>: In line with a real credit card, users will be able to set their monthly limit
and monthly spending rebates.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Credits</strong>: Collaborated with <a href="mong-nus.html">Mong Zheng Wei</a> to implement the /edit function.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Features implemented:</strong> I have implemented the ability to manage credit card expenditures</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What it does</strong>: Each <code>card</code> is able to <code>add</code>, <code>delete</code>, <code>edit</code>, and <code>list</code> card expenditures which
helps users manage their credit card spending.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: The convenience of purchasing things on credit and making one payment for all purchases
at the end of the month is the reason why many people pays for purchases using a credit card.
In addition, most credit cards come with benefits such as reward points or cash back rebates.
This feature will allow users to track and manage their credit card expenditures on each of their cards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong>: In line with a real credit card, users will have to abide by their monthly card limit
when adding expenditures. When a particular card has reached its limit, the user will no longer be able to
add any expenditures to the card for the month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Credits</strong>: Collaborated with <a href="mong-nus.html">Mong Zheng Wei</a> to implement the <code>add</code> and <code>list</code>
card expenditures function.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Features implemented:</strong> I have implemented the ability to manage credit card bills</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>What it does</strong>: Each <code>card</code> is able to <code>add</code> and <code>delete</code> credit card bill payment to their bank savings account,
so that users can keep track of their monthly credit card bill payments in their bank account expenditures.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Justification</strong>: At the end of every month, users are expected to pay their credit card bill.
Thus, this feature will allow users to keep track of their monthly credit card bills in the savings account
used to make the bill payment, so that the payment is being reflected as their bank account expenditure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong>: When making a credit card bill payment using one of the bank savings account,
the credit card cash back rebates will be automatically deposited back to the savings account to reflect
the rebates earned for the month.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Credits</strong>: Collaborated with <a href="briantkm.html">Brian Tan Kian Ming</a> to move the credit card transactions
into <code>bankexpenditure</code> and <code>deposit</code>. I had to edit, write additional, and use some of his methods
in order to integrate my credit card bill expenditures with his bank expenditures.</p>
</li>
</ul>
